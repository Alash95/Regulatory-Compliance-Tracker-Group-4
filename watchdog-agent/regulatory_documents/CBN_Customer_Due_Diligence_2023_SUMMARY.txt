### Summary of the Central Bank of Nigeria (Customer Due Diligence) Regulations, 2023

#### Objectives and Application

  - If there is suspicion of money laundering or terrorism financing.
  
#### Customer Identification

- **Businesses**: Gather information such as business name, addresses, registration numbers, and documents confirming legal existence.
